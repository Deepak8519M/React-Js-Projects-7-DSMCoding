Great question!

### ✅ Short Answer:

You should install **`styled-components`** **in your frontend (React app)** — **not in the backend**.

---

### 💡 Why?

- **`styled-components`** is a **CSS-in-JS** library for styling React components.
- It **runs in the browser** during component rendering.
- Your **backend (e.g., Node.js, Express)** does **not render UI**, so it doesn't need this library.

---

### ✅ How to install `styled-components` in your React app:

If you're using **npm**:

```bash
npm install styled-components
```

Or with **yarn**:

```bash
yarn add styled-components
```

And if you're using TypeScript, also add types:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/styled-components
```

---

### 🔧 Usage example in React:

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
`;

function App() {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
}
```

---

### 📦 In summary:

| Environment               | Install `styled-components`? |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| React App (Frontend)      | ✅ Yes                       |
| Node.js/Express (Backend) | ❌ No                        |

---

Great observation! Here's a clear explanation:

---

### ✅ Why `styled-components` is in **`dependencies`** (not `devDependencies`):

> **Because `styled-components` is used at runtime in your React app.**

---

### 📦 Difference Between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`

| Type              | Purpose                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dependencies`    | Packages needed when your app **runs in production** (e.g. in the browser) |
| `devDependencies` | Packages needed **only during development or build** (e.g. ESLint, Vite)   |

---

### 💡 So in your case:

- `styled-components` is used **inside React components** to style them.
- These styles are **generated dynamically at runtime**, so:

  ```js
  import styled from "styled-components"; // this runs in browser
  ```

- Therefore, it **must be included in `dependencies`**, so it's bundled with your app when built and sent to users.

---

### ✅ Examples of what goes where:

| Package              | Where it belongs  | Why                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `react`, `react-dom` | `dependencies`    | Needed to run your React app               |
| `styled-components`  | `dependencies`    | Used for styling **during runtime**        |
| `vite`, `eslint`     | `devDependencies` | Only used in development and build process |
| `@types/react`       | `devDependencies` | Only used by TypeScript for type-checking  |

---

### ⚠️ What if you accidentally put it in `devDependencies`?

- The app **may work in development**.
- But in **production build**, you'll likely see errors like:

  ```
  styled is not defined
  Cannot read property 'default' of undefined
  ```

---

Absolutely! Let’s break down the difference between **`dependencies`** and **`devDependencies`** in a way that’s super simple and practical to understand.

---

## 🧱 What Are They?

### ✅ `dependencies`

- These are the **core packages** your app needs **to run** — both in **development** and **production**.
- Think of these as the building blocks that are **actually bundled** into your app when it's shipped to users.

📦 Examples:

- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `styled-components`
- `axios`
- `redux`

These are used **inside your app code** — in components or logic that will run in the browser.

---

### 🛠️ `devDependencies`

- These are the tools and helpers you use **while developing**, **building**, or **testing** your app.
- They are **not needed** when your app is running in production.

📦 Examples:

- `vite` (build tool)
- `eslint` (code linting)
- `prettier` (code formatting)
- `@types/react` (only used for TypeScript development)
- `jest` (testing library)

They **help you write, test, or build** your app but do not end up in the final app sent to users.

---

## 🔍 How They're Differentiated

When you install a package:

### ✅ To install in `dependencies` (default)

```bash
npm install styled-components
# OR
yarn add styled-components
```

### 🧪 To install in `devDependencies`

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint
# OR
yarn add --dev eslint
```

## 🧠 Simple Analogy

Imagine you're building a pizza:

| Tool                       | Belongs To        | Why                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Dough, cheese, toppings    | `dependencies`    | They're part of the pizza 🍕   |
| Oven, pizza cutter, gloves | `devDependencies` | Only needed while making it 👨‍🍳 |

| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Needed in production                | ✅ Yes                          | ❌ No                                     |
| Used at runtime                     | ✅ Yes (e.g., `react`, `axios`) | ❌ No (e.g., `vite`, `eslint`)            |
| Installed by default                | ✅ Yes                          | ✅ Yes (except in some deployment setups) |
| Used for building, testing, linting | ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes                                    |

fontFamily: "Urbanist" - font family

height: 100vh;
background-image: url("/bg.png");
background-size: cover;

here height should be given other wise image will not be visible

Great — you're looking at a **global style definition** using `styled-components`. Let me explain it clearly:

---

## 🎯 What is this?

```js
const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: "Urbanist", sans-serif;
  }
`;
```

This is using the `createGlobalStyle` function from `styled-components` to define **global CSS rules** for your React app — just like what you'd write in a global `index.css` file.

---

### ✅ What Each Line Does:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;       // Makes padding + border included in width/height
  margin: 0;                    // Removes default margin for all elements
  padding: 0;                   // Removes default padding for all elements
  font-family: "Urbanist", sans-serif;  // Sets global font to Urbanist
}
```

---

## 📦 Where is `createGlobalStyle` from?

It’s from `styled-components`. You should import it like this:

```js
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components';
```

---

## 🧩 How to Use `GlobalStyle` in Your App

1. Import and render it **once**, usually at the top level (`App.js`):

```js
import React from 'react';
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components';

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: "Urbanist", sans-serif;
  }
`;

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <div>Hello World</div>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

---

## 💡 Important: Add the font too!

Since you're using `"Urbanist"`, make sure it's loaded. Add this in `index.html`:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Urbanist&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Part                     | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `createGlobalStyle`      | Define CSS styles applied app-wide        |
| `font-family`            | Sets the font globally                    |
| `box-sizing: border-box` | Fixes element sizing issues (recommended) |

Great question! Let’s break it all down clearly:

---

## 🔧 What’s Happening in Your Code?

```js
const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:9000/";

const fetchFoodData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(BASE_URL);
};
```

You’re preparing a function to **fetch data** from a local backend server running on port `9000`. Now let’s explain the key parts:

---

## 🧠 1. Why is `BASE_URL` in CAPITALS?

✅ This is a **naming convention** (not a rule) in JavaScript.

> When you define constants that **never change**, especially values like URLs, API keys, or config options — you use **UPPERCASE** to signal that it's a "constant".

### Example:

```js
const API_KEY = "my-secret-key"; // capital: constant
const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:9000/"; // capital: fixed config
```

You **can** write it as `baseUrl`, but by writing `BASE_URL`, you're saying:

> "Hey, don’t change this!"

---

## ⚙️ 2. What does `async` do?

The `async` keyword makes a function **asynchronous**, meaning:

* The function can **pause and wait** for things (like data from a server).
* It always **returns a Promise** automatically.

### Example:

```js
const getData = async () => {
  return "hello";
};

// This returns a promise that resolves to "hello"
```

---

## ⏳ 3. What does `await` do?

`await` is used **inside async functions only**. It **waits** for a Promise to finish before continuing.

In your code:

```js
const response = await fetch(BASE_URL);
```

This line says:

> “Wait for the server to respond before moving to the next line.”

It avoids the need for `.then()` and makes code cleaner and more readable.

---

### 🔁 So your function:

```js
const fetchFoodData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(BASE_URL);
};
```

is doing this:

1. Sends a **GET request** to `http://localhost:9000/`.
2. **Waits** for the server to respond (`await`).
3. Stores the response in the `response` variable.

To complete this function, you would typically also:

* Convert the response to JSON
* Store it in state

### ✅ Full Version:

```js
const fetchFoodData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(BASE_URL);
    const result = await response.json();
    setData(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch data:", error);
  }
};
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Term       | Meaning                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `BASE_URL` | A constant (by convention: written in uppercase)      |
| `async`    | Allows the function to pause and wait for async tasks |
| `await`    | Waits for a Promise to resolve before moving forward  |

---

Great! Let’s now **deep dive into Promises**, especially in the context of your code using `fetch()` and `async/await`.

---

## 🤔 What is a **Promise** in JavaScript?

A **Promise** is a special object in JavaScript that **represents the eventual result** (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.

### A Promise has 3 states:

| State       | Meaning                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `pending`   | The operation is still going on      |
| `fulfilled` | The operation completed successfully |
| `rejected`  | The operation failed (with an error) |

---

## 🧪 Example of a Promise (Basic)

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("Done!");
  } else {
    reject("Something went wrong!");
  }
});
```

You can handle it using:

```js
promise
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

---

## 🧵 Where is the Promise in your code?

```js
const fetchFoodData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(BASE_URL);
};
```

Here’s what’s happening:

### 🔹 `fetch(BASE_URL)`:

This returns a **Promise** immediately. That Promise will:

* 🕒 Try to contact the server.
* ✅ Resolve with the response if the server replies.
* ❌ Reject if there’s a network error or the server fails.

So, `fetch()` returns a Promise:

```js
const promise = fetch("http://localhost:9000/");
```

You can handle it like this:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:9000/")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.log("Error:", err));
```

But instead of using `.then()`, you're using:

```js
const response = await fetch(BASE_URL);
```

So `await` is waiting for that **fetch Promise to resolve**.

---

## 🔄 How does `async/await` relate to Promises?

`async/await` is just a **cleaner way** to write asynchronous code that deals with Promises.

Instead of:

```js
fetch()
  .then()
  .catch()
```

You can write:

```js
try {
  const res = await fetch();
  const data = await res.json();
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

This helps you **avoid callback hell** or messy nested `.then()` chains.

---

## 🔄 Rewriting Your Code With Promises Directly

Here's your code using raw Promises (no async/await):

```js
const fetchFoodData = () => {
  fetch(BASE_URL)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((result) => {
      setData(result);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Failed to fetch:", error);
    });
};
```

| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise`  | JS object for something that will complete in the future (async) |
| `fetch()`  | Returns a Promise that resolves to the server’s response         |
| `.then()`  | Runs after the Promise resolves                                  |
| `.catch()` | Runs if the Promise is rejected (error)                          |
| `async`    | Makes a function always return a Promise                         |
| `await`    | Waits for the Promise to resolve before moving to the next line  |
